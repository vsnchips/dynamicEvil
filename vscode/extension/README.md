# Dynamic Evil Plugin

Dynamic Evil is a collection of plugins which extend various programs with dynamic code execution functionality.

Great for prototyping new plugins and interactively exploring APIs.

## How to use
> Launch a debugging session for an in-progress VSCode plugin in the Extension Development Host.
> Write some more script.
> Highlight it.
> CTRL+SHIFT+P: DynamicEvil: Do It

If you use the plugin without the debugging host, the results are the same but you don't have the console.
